Welcome to Brevity.
-------------------

Brevity is a tool for drafting, negotiating, executing and amending contracts. 

The primary difference between Brevity and other offerings is that Brevity decomposes contracts into re-usable & immutable components. This means contracts for completely different purposes can enforce consistency in common clauses and users can create their own "templates" from existing contracts by cherry-picking components.


0.1: Prototype (done)
---------------------
What we made:

- document, node, socket data model
- compiler supporting raw text and latex

What we learned: 

- basic python syntax
- github
- vim

0.2: A big step forward (in progress)
--------------------------------------
What we are making:

- [x] separation of doc instance and doc model variables
- [x] unit testing
- [x] refactor data structure and data manipulation classes to provide enough flexibility for future versions
- [ ] amendment duality (simultaneously a standalone contract as well as an amending package)
- [ ] agreement which enforces internal consistency
- [x] host on Google App Engine
- [x] use NDB for persistence
- [ ] implement templating system for html views
- [ ] import/export objects via xml
- [ ] logging

What we are learning:

- generators
- visitor pattern
- builder pattern
- unit testing
- parsing xml
- debugging with pdb
- file manipulation
- mvc
- test driven development
- google app engine / webapp2 / webtest / ndb
- bootstrap
- jinja2



0.3 Make it (gasp!) useful 
----------------

- [ ] component versioning
- [ ] documents & agreements as state machines
- [ ] agreement slicing
- [ ] prototype web interface using Bootstrap
- [ ] data formatting
- [ ] prototype branding

0.4 Make it nimble and personal
------------------
- [ ] implement endpoints
- [ ] prototype mobile interface
- [ ] refine web interface
- [ ] implement google accounts
- [ ] metrics


0.5 Make it really useful
-------------------------

0.6 Make it social
------------------

0.7 Make money
--------------

0.8 Teach it how to learn
-------------------------

- [ ] Accounts
- [ ] Design interface
- [ ] Prototype interface
- [ ] Touch-screen document execution
- [ ] Payments
- [ ] Quality & timeliness feedback loops
