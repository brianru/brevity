Welcome to Brevity.
-------------------

Brevity is a tool for drafting, negotiating, executing and amending contracts. 

Please feel free to check out the code and forward any suggestions or feedback. 

_0.1_: Prototype (done)
What we made:
- document, node, socket data model
- compiler supporting raw text and latex
[x+, y-]
What we learned: 
- basic python syntax
- github
- vim

_0.2_ A big step forward (in progress)
What we are making:
- separate instance and default variables
- unit tests!
- flexible patterns to encapsulate using, storing, navigating and constructing document data
- compiler that supports raw text, latex and markdown
[x+, y-]
What we are learning: aspect oriented programming, decorators, iterators, generators, visitor pattern, builder pattern, unit testing
- [x] separation of doc instance and doc model variables
- [ ] unit testing
- [ ] refactor data structure and data manipulation classes to provide enough flexibility for future versions
- [ ] amendment duality (simultaneously a standalone contract as well as an amending package)
- [ ] Support markdown, .txt and LaTeX formats in parallel (strategy pattern for visitors)

_0.3_ Make it last
What we want to learn:
